# Fashion-MNIST-Dataset-Using-TensorFlow:

The Fashion MNIST dataset is an important dataset in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, which are divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples,it is used in Classifying the images of clothing like shirt, pants and sneakers.  Dataset contains 10 Classes, Image Size = 28 x 28 pixels, Label Ids = 0 to 9, Pixel value = 0 to 255.. Each image depicts one of 10 fashion categories, including T-shirts, dresses, sneakers, sandals, and more.

The Fashion MNIST dataset is important for several reasons:

--> It provides a challenging and diverse dataset for training and testing image recognition models. The images in the dataset are complex and varied, with significant variations in lighting, angle, and texture. As a result, models trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset tend to be more robust and generalizable than models trained on simpler datasets.

--> The dataset has become a standard benchmark for evaluating the performance of image recognition models. Many researchers and practitioners use the Fashion MNIST dataset as a standard for comparison when developing new algorithms and techniques for image recognition tasks.

--> The Fashion MNIST dataset is a useful tool for teaching and learning machine learning and computer vision concepts. It provides a practical and engaging example of how machine learning models can be used to solve real-world problems, and is widely used in educational contexts.

In conclusion, the machine learning and computer vision sectors can benefit much from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It offers a difficult and varied dataset for developing and testing image recognition models, is frequently used as a standard for measuring model performance, and is an important teaching and learning resource for machine learning ideas.
